You have 60 seconds to type the words that pop up on the screen as fast as you can if the words touch the bottom you lose.

The words are separated into three columns and you have a red dot to pick a column and type that word

And you can switch to other columns using arrow keys to type the words that pop up in those columns.

The difficulty of the game is that the interval of the words pop up are random and you can get big words
